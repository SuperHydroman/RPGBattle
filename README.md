# RPGBattle

### What is RPGBattle?
RPGBattle is an open-source turn-based RPG combat simulator built in **C#**. This project is part of my journey to master **C#** and software design through hands-on development. Feel free to make suggestions on my codebase, make merge requests and ask for new features.

The idea is that you are the **_Chosen One_**. You get to create your own Hero by choosing a class, selecting starter perks or skills, and giving your hero a name. Each class has its own base stats such as defense, speed, damage, luck, and charisma. As you progress, additional perks and abilities will be unlocked to further customize your playstyle.

### Current Status
The project is far from finished, but I am determined to keep improving it and turn it into a polished console RPG experience without relying on game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine. Think of it as Final Fantasy or Pokémon-style combat in a console.

Current features:
* Basic character creation (name only)
* Automated combat system (round-based)

### How do I install RPGBattle?
Currently, RPGBattle needs to be built from source.
1. Go to the [latest](https://github.com/SuperHydroman/RPGBattle/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) release or clone the repository
2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g. [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com))
3. **Build** and **run** the project
