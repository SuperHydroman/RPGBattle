# BattleRPG

### What is BattleRPG?
BattleRPG is an open-source C# Console Application I am creating for learning C#. Feel free to make suggestions on my codebase, make merge requests and ask for new features.

The idea is that you are the **_Chosen One_**. You get to create your own Hero, this is done by choosing a class, specific Perks / Skill, and a name.
There will be different classes (in the future) each with their own base stats, e.g. defense, speed, damage, luck, charisma.

### Current Status
The project is far from finished, but I am determined to keep working on this project and make it a real banger without the need of Unity of UE5 for example.
I personally think this can become a cool thing. Think of it as Final Fantasy or Pokémon styled combat in a console.

### How do I install BattleRPG?
1. Go to the [releases](github.com/SuperHydroman/RPGBattle/releases) of this project and download the latest version.
2. Build the project via an IDE (like Rider for example). Now you should be all good to go and play the game.
