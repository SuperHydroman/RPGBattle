# RPGBattle

### What is RPGBattle?
RPGBattle is an open-source **C# Console Application** I am creating for learning **C#**. Feel free to make suggestions on my codebase, make merge requests and ask for new features.

The idea is that you are the **_Chosen One_**. You get to create your own Hero, this is done by choosing a class, specific Perks / Skills, and a name. There will be different classes (in the future) each with their own base stats, e.g. defense, speed, damage, luck, charisma.

### Current Status
The project is far from finished, but I am determined to keep working on this project and make it a real banger without the need of Unity of UE5 for example.

I personally think this can become a cool thing. Think of it as Final Fantasy or Pokémon styled combat in a console.

### How do I install RPGBattle?
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/SuperHydroMan/RPGBattle/releases) of this project and download the latest version.
2. Build the project via an IDE (like [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for example). Now you should be all good to go and play the game.
